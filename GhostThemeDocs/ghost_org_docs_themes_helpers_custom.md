The `@custom` property provides access to custom theme settings, which are available anywhere in your theme.

The attributes of the `@custom` property are set by individual themes in the `package.json` file. Depending on the type of setting, the `@custom` property can then be used with the `{{#if}}` or `{{#match}}` helpers to customise the theme behaviour based on user settings.

### Example code

```html
<body class="{{body_class}} {{#match @custom.typography "Elegant serif"}}font-alt{{/match}}">
    ...
    <section class="footer-cta">
        {{#if @custom.cta_text}}<h2>{{@custom.cta_text}}</h2>{{/if}}
        <a href="#portal/signup">Sign up now</a>
    </section>
</body>

```

More information about creating and working with custom theme settings can be found [here](https://ghost.org/docs/themes/custom-settings/).
