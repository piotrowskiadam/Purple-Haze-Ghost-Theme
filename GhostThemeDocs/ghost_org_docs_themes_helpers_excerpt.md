Usage: `{{excerpt}}`

### Description

`{{excerpt}}` outputs content but strips all HTML. This is useful for creating excerpts of posts.

If the post’s `custom_excerpt` property is set, then the helper will always output the `custom_excerpt` content ignoring the `words` & `characters` attributes.

When both `html` and `custom_excerpt` properties are not set (for example, when member content gating strips the `html`) the output is generated from post’s `excerpt` property.

You can limit the amount of text to output by passing one of the options:

`{{excerpt characters="140"}}` will output 140 characters of text (rounding to the end of the current word).
